# Rainfall-Prediction

# Abstract: 

Rainfall prediction plays a crucial role in various domains, including agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. In recent years, researchers have explored machine learning models to enhance the accuracy of rainfall predictions. This study focuses on leveraging linear regression, along with other popular models, to improve rainfall forecasting. The models used like Linear Regression: Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique that establishes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable

# A.DATA SET 
The rainfall prediction dataset is a comprehensive collection of historical weather data from various geographical regions. It encompasses information on average rainfall, wind speed, humidity, temperature, and climate conditions it captures monthly and yearly variations in rainfall patterns across different places. For each location, the dataset records the highest and lowest average rainfall, providing insights into extreme weather events.

# RAINFALL PREDICTION DATASET
 Moreover, the dataset includes wind speed data, which correlates with rainfall patterns. High wind speeds often accompany heavy rainfall, while calm winds may indicate drier conditions. Humidity levels also play a significant role, affecting precipitation rates and overall climate comfort. Temperature data further enriches the dataset, revealing seasonal trends. For instance, tropical regions exhibit consistent warmth, leading to higher average rainfall. In contrast, temperate climates experience distinct seasons, impacting precipitation distribution. 

# Algorithms Implemented:

 In this project Dogecoin price prediction and prediction, we use three approaches:

• Linear regression 

• K-Nearest Neighbour
 
• Support Vector Machine 

• Decision Tree 

• Random Forest

# FUTURE SCOPE 


•We can easily conclude that for rainfall prediction this is the best way to use it by forming a range of highest and lowest predicted values by adding bias in the model
 
•Future scope of rainfall prediction The future scope of rainfall prediction is very promising, with advancements in technology and data analysis techniques. Some of the potential developments in this field include:
• Improvements in Data Collection
• Integration of Big Data
