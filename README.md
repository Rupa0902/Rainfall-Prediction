# Rainfall-Prediction

# Abstract: 

Rainfall prediction plays a crucial role in various domains, including agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. In recent years, researchers have explored machine learning models to enhance the accuracy of rainfall predictions. This study focuses on leveraging linear regression, along with other popular models, to improve rainfall forecasting. The models used like Linear Regression: Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique that establishes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable
